**Quotes:** 

the muse of thought and meditation. Melete literally means "ponder" and "contemplation" in Greek.

there were three original Muses: Aoidē ("song" or "voice"), Meletē ("practice" or "occasion"), and Mnēmē ("memory"). Together, these three form the complete picture of the preconditions of poetic art in cult practice.

**Notes:**

The essence of this project is to create an AI that can act as a muse for an architect, whether that means conversing and understanding a project's requirements and developing early concepts at the initial stages or converging on a schematic design.

Design typically follows a double diamond pattern. Very early on, ideas from a wide range of inspirational sources are considered, and it makes more sense to broaden and diverge towards many potential ideas and solutions. Then the physical form of architecture starts to take shape on a site and additional considerations start to whittle down and converge on a select few design options. Discussions amongst the team usually re-open consideration to unexplored avenues and the project undergoes another diamond shaped iterative cycle towards finalizing the architectural design.

An AI for architecture should generally follow through these cycles as a natural creative partner for architects and design teams at all stages.
