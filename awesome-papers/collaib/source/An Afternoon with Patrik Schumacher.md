KB: Parametric urbanism is typically homogenous field of differentiated geometries. Instead articulate buildings within parametric approach

PS: New take - do without a hierarchical masterplan, yet interventions share an ethos of discovering and continuing relations and continuities. Instead of a system of multiple parameters do something bottom up

KB: How does the building, once developed, affect the other new developments?

PS: In a thousand different ways - as long as aprior concept is, it MUST affect the others. No minimalism, no postmodernism otherwise its top down. We need to converge on first principles, abstract

KB: What about historic preservation?

PS: I'm for it. We need to integrate with those existing buildings - I do not assume a tabula rasa approach

MB: What do you say about a parametricism that only builds but doesn't demolish

PS: That seems arbitrary, let the markets decide

MB: Keeping historic buildings introduces interesting complexity

PS: Sure it can be a default setting

LZ: You want to achieve some emergent order bottom up - its arbitrary

PS: It's not arbitrary. Look at nature

MB: It's beautiful because of destruction as well - there will be massive failures of buildings in order for the order to emerge.  You'll need a regenerative process

PS: OK as long as it follows common principles

KB: What about vernacular architecture?

PS: It doesn't have to be vernacular.

LZ: What are vernacular builders adapting to if not nature?

PS: Natural environment but also the metabolism of societal life, life sustaining vitality. Contemporary condition has rejected a strong hand of central planning and urbanism

MB: So Paris no more

PS: No one has planned London. Whoever can come up with a master plan will produce a strait-jacket of hindrances. An architect's task is to articulate a building in accordance with the market forces, affiliations to retail elements, night life elements. The buildings as textures will be legible in radiating these affiliations. The ingredients for the locations for the design will be relevant and be able to re-discovered for the occupants of buildings

IS: Are there any pre-conditions to let this approach thrive? Can architects shape those pre-conditions

PS: Two - 1) market freedoms and processes, 2) discipline is living up to its own computational capabilities and shared values. 1) is out of our reach, 2) is within our reach.

IS: A consensus?

PS: It is a consensus

LZ: Instead of central planning we get design requirements from a client/business/invisible hand. How is this better esp since we are not economists and have no idea why the market gives us the design requirement? How is it relevant architecturally?

PS: The briefs will be much more attuned to the context, and we want to attune the morphology to the context

KB: Conditions taht dead to design are embeddeded into contextual object surrounding the site, the architect would have to understand the dynamics in relationship with that site that would form the rules for location

PS: The criteria and the rules will be a creative act because there are many different ways you can relate elements to each other

KB: Design would be a trivial exercise...Also every building in the site has to be thoroughly investigated

PS: I would expect the developer to have those inform the programming already. I expect that with cities things will be much more integrated...

MB: But historically markets have not been able to provide that level of investigation and integration. This sounds like Friedman/Hayek/libertarian political economics

PS: It has to!

MB: It may be better for you to advance your parametricism if you said it is compatible with various political economic schools of thought.

PS: In the beginning i thought presumed social democratic society, then challenged myself to consider the market radicalization since it seemed like that was the trajectory of the world instead of social democracy, then personally decided that that market radicalization is likely the best for ensuring prosperity. But I agree that parametricism is the best approach regardless of political economic thinking and it's not tied to market liberalism

MB: OK!

PS: As an architectural theorist I do have to prove that parametricism works under free markets. I don't think modernism can cope with it.

IS: What's the mechanism for the consensus in the architect discipline?

PS: Academia, research papers, lectures. It doesn't take much. Look at Bauhaus - Gropius, Mies meet in an office and then

KB: Well there is a diffusion of styles/approaches right now. There is a rejection of technology

PS: We need to be impatient and reject this. And we prove that parametricism works with great projects

KB: This parametricism book (The Autopoiesis of Architecture) is very dense. Domino house made modernism very simple and easy to proliferate

MB: And Domino House was never built!

PS: It's just problematic if the field ignores recent technology like doctors ignoring the Genome Project

There was a necessary discursive culture in the 80s to re-think architecture without prejudices and then out of that came post modernism and deconstructivism and now this brainstorming session must move on to filtering and selecting. The institutions are too free-wheeling

MB: We also lack an interest in environmental psychology. I am just not convinced parametricism has to be the unifying approach

PS: I am doing research in agent based modeling

MB: What about a Style X that overlaps with parametricism but just uses boxes, because that's what people like?

PS: That's a bit a false humanism. Why constrain yourself and limit what you can achieve?

MB: I mean look at a keyboard with 88 keys, no pianist really wishes they had access to the sounds in between.

KB: What about Object Oriented Ontology?

PS: Are you just trying to re-brand parametricism?

KB: Maybe...

MB: He is offering you a way!

PS: OOO and other approaches involving positive structures (virtuality?) are interesting but have really re-expressed what I already knew

KB: Parametric urbanism creates an object greater than a person's perception. If everything is bottom up when will you ever achieve a whole identity?

PS: I am not excluding free associations and markets, negotiated/collective action to amplify an emergent order, or even a dialectic of master planning. We do have to show that architecture can be congenial with bottom up emergent order

MB: Parametricism is opening territories very well and very fast, but the territory it opens is very vast that doesn't entail some of the outcomes that you hope for.

PS: But I do like how it opens it up more than other architecture approaches.

MB: Vocabulary (walls floors) of architects are impoverished

PS: Then you don't know our discipline

MB: Well I mean there are things to visualize which isn't encompassed by the vocabulary which you cannot see

PS: Curves are superior, see my previous lecture

MB: Well I do like curves :)

LZ: Well how can you first say you don't car about final outcomes only the criteria but then say that about curves. Will you question a straight line as an outcome of parametric process simply because it's a straight line?

KB: Yeah I think you might by lying..:)

IS: And it's also a question of legibility.

...

Later discussion

PS: I find that modernism settles on straight lines and boxes that lack visual representation of many important relations to its social context, site, etc. That's why I doubt them. If the visual representation can instead communicate these relations, then the architecture can become more legible. That is the semiological infinite project that I am interested in.

My concern with environmental psychology it could over-naturalize certain design features when we are also pursuing a creative project of inventing a visual language and writing text.
