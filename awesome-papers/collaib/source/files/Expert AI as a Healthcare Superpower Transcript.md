VP: I'm the founding General partner of the a16z bio and health fund 

MA: and I'm Mark Andreessen the co-founder of a16z 

VP: mark thank you so much for joining us
it's great to be here so
you famously wrote about software eating
the world and that was basically what 10
plus years ago and actually that
very much seems to have come to fruition
if you look at all these other
industries that software really wasn't a
part of software's actually become a
dominant part but actually this year's
been kind of an amazing year for another
type of software for AI and I'm curious
to sort of talk about the Arc of what we
think is going to happen in the future
based on what we've seen in the past and
and really how this new technology is
going to change everything much like
we've seen software change the last 10
years I'm curious what you think for
just like this year it's been kind of an
amazing year it always seem like not
much happens in any given year but 2022
seems to have been an amazing year for
AI right
also Vladimir Lenin once said
there are decades in which nothing
happens
and then there are weeks in which
decades happen
and let's not hope that happens
politically anymore
but it does happen in
science and technology it does happen
there are sort of moments where things
kind of hit critical mass
and this the sort of AI
machine learning Revolution seems it
seems like that's what's happening right
now it's been interesting to
watch it's sort of like it
feels to me at least it was like there
was like a breakthrough moment in 2012
right that had to do with images
and then there was a lot of work you
know subsequently valid to
things like the creation of self-driving
cars based on that and then
there was some it feels like some
natural language breakthrough maybe
three years ago
and now that's really catalyzed into
this kind of whole thing that
we see happening around GPT and
text generation
and then even other
other applications transcription you
know is getting much better all of a
sudden speech synthesis is getting much
better
and then now you've got this artistic
Revolution happening with image
image creation and now video
creation is right next
coming up now really fast
and so it seems like one of those
catalytic moments and then it it's
it's it's like every week now
there's like fun it seems like there's
like fundamental breakthroughs there's
research papers there's product releases
coming out so it seems like a cascading
thing the way I think about it as a
software person sort of
lifelong programmer
is that they're basically in
the fullness of time it will appear I
think that there were kind of two
different ways to write software there
was the sort of the old way to write
software which is sort of the classic
Von Neumann machine
deterministic way and the whole
problem with writing software in the old
model is like computers are hyper
literal right and so they do exactly
what you tell them traditionally right
every time they do something wrong it's
because you have instructed them in
properly and it's your very humbling
experience to learn as a young
programmer that everything is your
fault
and the Machine will just sit and
wait for you to fix the problem like
it's not it's not gonna it's not going
to do that on its own and then
there's this new there's this other way
to write software and this has to do
with having these
these AI systems and then having
training data training the systems
tweaking the systems
and the sort of capability
that the way I described it to
kind of normies is though that
sort of unlocks the ability for
computers to more and more interact with
the real world and with the
messiness of the real world right and
the probabilistic nature of the real
world well it seems almost less
like writing software almost like
training something that's right when I
think about machine learning and image
recognition you talked about it felt
like it was almost like training a dog
right like reinforcement learning is
like we'll give treats as it gets better
but there's something different now it
feels like I don't know we've gone from
like training a dog to recognize a bird
versus like a hot dog or hot dog or not
hot dog or so on to actually something
where it feels closer like training a
person or I don't know how you feel like
when we talk about learning and training
and data like what are we training
what is where do you think we are in
that Arc of getting to like eventually
HAL 9000 and so on well so I while
this has been happening if you
have kids like I have a young
young child so I have a seven-year-old
now so as this stuff has all been
popping I've been simultaneously
training and training now the seven year
old any anybody who's
had who's had kids will recognize what
kind of what I'm about to say
but it is really interesting
watching little kids the way I think
about they're at least at least at least
the little kid I have who's great
it's like it's like everything
for the first for the first few years
it's like every single thing he did was
like a little applied physics experiment
which is like let's see what happens if
I drop this let's see what happens if I
eat this let's see what happens if I do
this to Daddy right and see what the
response is and they just run experiment
and you can see it you can see it very
clearly when they're like learning how
to walk because they're like running all
these experiments about how to stand up
and what to hold on to and they keep
falling over and then at some point like
good it's a little neural network
like actually figures it out it does
learn off in a way they go right
and so clearly it's like
it's kind of it's a little bit
Eerie like you can see that a similar
kind of thing happening look
having said that like the you
know the human brain just like you
developing and then It
ultimately it clearly has
Consciousness achieves higher
levels of consciousness achieves higher
levels of sort of self-knowledge you
know reaches the Descartes kind
of stage where it sort of has
self-awareness clearly is
very creative from an early age I'm a
little less convinced that the tech
software Technologies we have now are
like on some linear path towards just
like quote-unquote AGI or just quote
unquote like Consciousness like us it's
hard for me to believe that conscious
Consciousness is just simply like
emergent from like higher scale neural
networks like I that to me seems
like a hand wave now having said
that I have a lot of smart friends who
are pretty sure that that's what's going
to happen so actually I feel that
way as well so I want to get to AGI in a
bit I mean and also we can debate where
the Consciousness is an illusion as it
is but where we are now is kind
of amazing like can people can take like
gpt3 you can give it SAT exams it can do
okay like actually it can do quite well
I can do scores it like the so
the one I saw that scored it like with
1200 something like that
so it's not bad right I can do homework
I actually gave it like acid
questions like to explain the
derivation for the source trial radius
the black hole radius to write
a code for let's say eight by eight
tic-tac-toe like random things that you
should never be able to do because it's
not just memorizing it it's generalizing
right and it's getting that but then
also it actually seems to have some sort
of rear weird hiccups and that
actually one thing that really does not
seem to get is humor right
so I'm kind of curious where you
think it's going to go because before we
get to AGI there are things that an
average human can do pretty well that
GPT 3 can't but then there's also what
experts can do and what I'm very
curious about is actually we may get to
some of the expert stuff first before
it can do even something like humor the
irony is that something like humor that
we take for granted might actually be
really hard and other areas might be
easier right well the ultimate example
of the things that can't do like it
can't my pecker suitcase like
there's no robot that will pack your
suitcase it will and if you try to
get her like make an omelette like
it'll shred your clothes they're not
so it could drive your car
but it can't pack your suitcase so
you can't do your laundry
so there are there are these
interesting kind of kind of twists I
so I would describe a little bit as
followed us which is I think the
this generation of AI that we have as
impressive it is it is a little bit of a
sleight of hand which we'll maybe
talk about and then but I also think
actually to your point human
consciousness or human intelligence is
also a little bit of hand
maybe slightly different slides of hands
so the sleight of hand that you see
when you're using GPT or one of
these image generation things is it's
not literally creating new information
like what it's doing is it is it
doesn't have like it has no opinion
it has no like point of view it has
no like it's not sitting there
like thinking on its own coming up with
some new thing what it's doing is
it's basically training ideally
what it's doing this is training on the
subtotal of all existing human knowledge
so for text generation it's
training on all existing human texts
right and so it plays back at you
basically projections from the sort of
assembled composite of all
when you ask it to do the eight by eight
like so probably somebody on the
internet at some point wrote some paper
about it I thought it's a little more
than that because it because I asked
like 56 by 56 or 101 by 101 it has
some sense of generalization but
but I'll bet we can check this I'll bet
if we Google long enough I'll bet we
could find a paper that described a
general purpose algorithm for
multi oh that may be right
it's like somebody did that
I've done the same humor experiment I
like have it right Seinfeld scripts and
sometimes they're really funny and
sometimes they're just like it
makes no sense I went for curb but
it's the same idea exactly but
like look there are a lot of jokes on
the internet right and so you'd have to
kind of you could kind of go back and
kind of say okay it probably like pluck
these jokes or by the way maybe there
was a paper somewhere where they
articulated a general theory of humor
right because this has been humor's been
studied as a as a thing and maybe
there's like a general thing of like
humors like the unexpected or whatever
and so it generalizes well it could
be too like all sitcoms might be the
same sitcom at some level right well
so here would be an example so Matt
I also how to do like dramatic
screenplays we've got a dramatic
customers it's quite good if it was like
three you could say like write a
three-act screenplay it will do it
and it will have the proper like setup
and resolution and so forth but
there are systems for like screenwriting
in Hollywood where they have like three
acts and then they have it's all
Rocky or It's All Star Wars well so
so actually it's really interesting that
maybe what we think is magical when
humans do it isn't actually all that
magical either so that's what I was
going to say so then the human
sleight of hand is like is
there actually free will is there is
there actually creativity happening
upstairs by the way if there is
is it everybody is there really a
thousand types of movies or is there
like one latent space of the monomyth
and basically what's happening I think
the theory just I'm kind
of making this up but I think the theory
would be the hero with a thousand faces
or the the idea of the Union hero's
journey which is sort of the
basis for all of these plots in Star
Wars and Harry Potter and everything
else
a somebody with your
background might say that basically it's
sort of algorithm for surfing human
neurochemistry right and
generating different like sort
of neuron chemical responses to
like fear and anxiety and you
know love and all these other all these
other things
I've always been fascinated there's
this thing in Psychology called core
affect Theory wow that one I don't know
oh this is great so okay so what
do humans have all these love and
despair like we have all these different
emotions to celebrate core ethic Theory
says no we don't oh or no
good bad good or bad and then
Higher Love
and so we either have like a positive
like we either have like a positive
a neural response or a negative
neural response and then it's either
high intensity or low intensity and then
you just basically and so it's like
wistfulness is like just
slightly negative but like
despair is like extremely negative
and then so it's all too
by two it's a two by two and it's
and we're more basic organisms than we
think and then we just we retro
as and we're very one of the things
that's great known is humans are very
good at creating a story to justify
whatever happened right
and so we create these stories these
scripts around this idea of an emotion
but it's basically just justifying the
neural response and so the
cynical view would be like having an ice
cream cone on a hot Bay and like falling
in love are like the same thing well
maybe nor chemically neurochemically
maybe they are well this comes into play
in like drug abuse right which
is things that generate
an opioid response like some people
get an opioid response from alcohol
right and they're former prone
to alcoholism a lot of people don't get
that response and so it's literally a
neurochemical thing so look
maybe we're maybe we're bundles of
neurochemistry to a much deeper extent
than or a much simpler extent than we
want to believe having said that
again oh and then that
that takes me the other thing on AI
which is I do one of the ways
that people are testing AI is with the
so-called Turing test right and the
simplified form of the Turing test is
you're chatting with somebody that
maybe a human or maybe a bot and you
chat for 20 minutes and can you guess
better than random history human
robot that my take on that
is to turn Alan Turing was a
genius but the Turing test is malformed
humans are too easy to trip
but that's too low of a
bar because tricking a person is not
that hard and does not prove anything
other than you've tricked the person
like like I think and this is
relevant because I think things
like GPT are about to pass the Turing
test
exactly
and so I think it's going to turn out
that was too lightweight of a test
well here's my favorite
example for why I know GPT is not
self-aware if you ask it if it's
self-aware and you ask it to
elaborate on how it became self-aware it
will happily tell you and by the way
if you ask it if how it's going to feel
if you if you turn it off it's going to
tell you please don't
if you ask it to explain to you why
it's not self-aware it will very
happily do that too it does not have a
differential opinion about those two
outcomes whereas every living
every conscious not ever even
even no consciously any living
organism has a very different response
to those two scenarios it's been amazing
because in some ways I feel like it's as
much been interesting to study the AI as
the AIS reflected for us to study
ourselves and I think we are
sort of seeing that the magician has
certain tricks whether it's the AI
magician or the human magician and
it's going through this education
process I'm curious though like it feels
like so like GPT can get
into a high school or get into college
let's say but like what would it take
for it to get its PhD and
like we're I think that's where
the sort of dramatic stuff is to come
well so again it's exactly your
point it's not stress I would ask the
question the other way which is like
well okay what does it take to get a PhD
what does it take for Humanity like
how are the universities doing
how are they doing
on quality control of their own programs
how many people are getting phds
today that we would say are like
actually valid like
whatever actual accomplishments
by the way
people who got professors
have years ago like how would they score
the phds that are being granted today
when they say wow would they say the bar
is lower I think they would say it
bars dramatically lower right
and so the answer might be
we haven't lowered the bar but same
thing for college admissions like you
know what does it take to get into
college but what does it take to finish
college and the education
system well this is coming up a lot
right now because it's like okay GPT can
Auto generate like essays right
and so student essays and so it's
like okay the great the grading method
of assign an essay and grade the result
like is probably not going to work
anymore but it's like okay was that
ever actually like just because we
thought that was education was that
actually education like what was that
actually teaching anybody anything like
actually I'm sure someone's going to
take that to apply to colleges oh
absolutely challenge
applications are basically done at
least at least to the extent that you
believe that college applications were a
legitimate way to evaluate anybody in
the first place no it's dark
it's done I'd be more skeptical that
they were ever useful in the first one
too right
well so in the PC let's talk
about like at least in that old school
mentality of a PhD of some Advan
Advanced learning where you become an
expert in something right I
think that's the thing where what do you
mean by expert let's say the ability
to be in the top point one percent of
humanity of let's say designing a drug
or interesting doing something oh
is that what that is that
what they teach me well that's
that's presentation universities that is
my goal I wasn't aware of I wasn't aware
that was part of the curriculum I think
it is
or at least that's what you have to do
eventually when you get out right
and that you have to apply it I
think it's where I think it is one of
the things about being an expert in my
mind is that something that is the
difference between bad good and great
can be really close like I could
probably write a piece of music but no
one would think it's all that great you
know and then you could have someone
who's a good musician but not a great
one then you have like a genius like a
Mozart or a Led Zeppelin or whatever
particular genre and I think
we're we aren't there yet is that when
the difference between good and great is
so close right or like from spinal tap
there's a fine line between brilliant
and stupid right I think that
is where I think it hasn't really hit
yet right in that if you look at the
jokes the jokes are just kind of okay
the screenplays it makes are not like
brilliant screenplays right I think it
could get into college but could it win
best screenplay okay and so
that's this part where I think we're
we're gonna we're not there yet okay you
know but then I think we're getting
there so name a great music composer
generated by a music PhD program

name one I'm thinking more in the
the scientific side of things but I
don't think probably the PHD programs in
that space is probably not intended to
generate music okay made one
greatest screenplay written by a PhD in
drama
so that's an interesting point
but I think what I'm getting at is
still like the ability to do something
and so and the education part we can
talk about how they learn because I
think in the case of the screenplay or
the music you're talking about they
they still have to learn something right
they or do you think they just
innately sort of knew how to write a
screenplay I don't know I assume
there's a process where they write a
screenplay it's kind of mediocre oh
and then and then they get
critiqued or they critique themselves
and then and then it improves and
improves and improves well the
screenplay okay so the divorce
in the education
[Music]
question number one for screenplay is
does it sell to the studio will they
usually buy it and then that's
number two is when the movie comes out
and the TV show comes out does anybody
watch it people like it finish
it one of the fun things that
Netflix will now tell people who make
film and TV is they actually tell them
for the first time whether anybody's
actually finishing their movie

just all those stats are kind of
mind-blogging right a lot of
movies like and people go to
the theater and they feel
invested in and they don't want to leave
in the middle but like it's very
easy to punch out it turns out a
lot of screenplays this is
something that's professional
screenwriters will tell you like it
can't ever sag just as
one example because people will
stop watching so so
screenwriting is subject to Market
test popular music required test but
it's classical music which I'm a huge
fan of is no longer subject to Market
tests right it's thoroughly subsidized
that's interesting it's not in
the free market anymore or maybe
equivalents or music Movie music is you
know so Movie music is subject to Market
tests right and it's probably the modern
classical it is the modern classical
for that reason so like the
market test is real but let me
Grant your point so let's build on what
you said your point like let's use this
could we use the term paste maybe like
or just ability to do something
hard well ability so okay so ability to
do something hard and create let's say
create something hard
create something complicated and then
also the ability to judge
right and you're critically like
to start with judging your own work
and probably therefore in the ability to
prove and then therefore the ability to
prove right so I think that there's
there so there's something about
there's something about taste like
I tend to think this stuff all has
like aesthetic like a properly
constructed mathematical formula or
software program has aesthetic oh 100
right theorial design has aesthetic
properties physics
all of it so there's something
about taste that's like some combination
of quantitative qualitative like a
great start is like from a from a
mediocre one as taste right exactly
and like there's certain signals like
there's certain methods and certain
signals but it's not necessarily
reducible to an algorithm it's more of
like a composite it's sort of a
foundational knowledge combined with
some scope of experience combined with
some kind of ineffable
characteristic of judgments well we
associate an aesthetic with it but I
wonder whether that's also just our
emotional connection to it right you
know because I think we have this good
right or wrong or more right or more
wrong right like a gradient like
that's the right direction right and but
a lot of us also whether something is
elegant versus like just a hack right
you can tell whether these great things
are just simple and Powerful rather than
like some complicated machine to do
something that there's
gonna eventually fall apart or that
you think about that's true in
physics or in the go to market or in
or in music it has all that both that
sort of complexity and a simplicity at
the same time right
but so but I'm curious like so
when AI gets that point which I think
that's a win not an if okay
or so why would you say why
wouldn't it get there because like do we
even understand how it works in people
maybe we don't have to well maybe we
don't have to so this is where I
describe this is like the AGI
question I call the handwave
it's or the same thing the embedded
assumption that it's a win is that it
will be an emergent process that will
sort of unlock as a consequence of
greater and greater levels of scale
maybe one way of looking at
that is that is just what's going to
happen that's not even Consciousness
like that's obviously what's going to
happen the other impression that is it's
just a massive it's a hand wave it's a
hand wave and it's what the kids would
call it cope and the cope would be okay
so here let me ask you a question in
return what is the sub
specialty of human biology and
medicine that best understands the
nature of human consciousness today oh
I don't think there's a there is
one right there is one anesthesiology
okay which is poorly understood well
it's poorly understood but they know how
to turn it off but and they know
how to turn it back on they've got
the on off switch that's all we go
that's all we have like we have
been we collectively have been studying
this question of human consciousness for
a very long time we have very advanced
Technologies today functional MRI and
like all this stuff but that speaks
there's a field I would love to see
created which is molecular psychology
okay where you can start to
probe this one a little more than on off
okay and molecular so and this is
literal or metaphorical
quite literally like and so play like
molecular biology but this big thing in
the 80s where we finally can bring like
chemistry of small molecules to like
pocket biology or chemical biology as
well and if we could use like small
molecules to maybe perturb more than
just on off but like perturbs things we
can start to understand the brain a
little bit because reading is one thing
but like poking and sort of
perturbing and then seeing the result is
usually How We Do any sort of experiment
would you do that is that a
chemical experimentation would
that be electrical it could be either
one it could be any of that but it would
probably be some combinations like on a
track in theory so like look we
just don't okay so here would be the
counter argument is like we just we
don't know how human consciousness Works
we actually we've I actually I
didn't go in the film but I didn't go in
the actually was that was going to be
what I was going to study in school 30
years ago but I looked at the field at
the time and I was like they don't have
a clue like I'm going to spend my entire
career so you want to go into
Consciousness
but that was like expert
systems expert systems well there are
early neural networks and then a lot
of it got into brain chemistry and like
we're going to figure this stuff out and
we're gonna learn how to build
and it's just like they didn't know that
and as far as I know they don't know now
and so the counter argument would be
this is all just like massive cope for
the fact that we actually we don't
understand that so we don't understand
how to do it and so all we can do is
hand wave and kind of just say well it's
just going to be a version and it's like
no it's not and we're going to be
sitting here 30 years from now and we're
still not going to have any more
knowledge barring other
scientific breakthroughs of the kind
that you're talking about what's
interesting is if you think about that
time we had neural Nets but they were
all single layer basically and then they
couldn't even do xor you
couldn't even do some simple things
because you needed deeper networks to
get at them and you couldn't have deep
networks in because we didn't have the
computational power and so the space was
pretty dormant for a while AI
until like we started going to having
the basically just the computational
power from gpus and other things to be
able to go deep and then you could feed
the data through so it is possible that
we sort of have a point where we sort of
saturate the compute that we have now we
get to as much as we can get to and that
may get close to AGI maybe not and
then takes another like 30 years to get
to the next sort of breakthroughs to get
there
but okay so but I would pull back from
there so AGI is the fun thing there is a
sort of step back which is to pick a
domain and the domains I
think a lot about like life sciences
designing drugs doing Health Care
like seeing if you can do it pick a
diagnosis can you suggest a drug in
those areas now we're talking about much
more limited domain so we're now talking
about we don't we don't need to go all
the way to Consciousness for that
necessarily you can you can have
something that's more limited in that
limited domain right now it seems like
generative AI isn't quite far enough yet
to be able to like I don't see the
examples quite yet sure well let's
we'll see I mean so what's the
what's the counter and I know you
especially think about Healthcare a lot
well so the first thing is
whenever you're scoring well let's talk
about medical diagnosis which is kind of
just low hanging fruit Yeah question
because everybody experiences
it so to start up front you have to ask
a question up front which is like is the
goal what's the threshold is the
threshold perfect or is the threshold
better than human that's a great
Point right and by the
way this is a topic that comes
up all the time it's all right in cars
right which is it perfect it will
never make a mistake or is it just going
to be better than human in the
way that self-driving cars score this is
accidents per thousand miles driven and
self-driving cars are already lower than
human drivers and humans may actually be
getting worse
by the way it increased forms
in certain kinds of drug abuse right
and then of course the machines have
the characteristic they get better
universally right so a car a car has one
mishap in one location every other car
gets trained on how to deal with that in
the future where the Learning
Happens across the entire system
and so like I think you can make a
serious argument that like basically
self-driving cars are already Better
Than People on a relative basis and
therefore like morally you could even go
so far as to say human drivers should be
outlawed today right like it would be
like if you have the alternative you can
have the self-driving car then
like the utilitarian I'm not a
utilitarian but the utilitarian argument
would be you should obviously ban human
drivers today because the machine driven
stuff is already better probably by the
way the same is true for airplanes right
now we're not actually going to do that
and there are other considerations
involved and so forth but like
logically speaking you should at least
think about that as a possibility and I
think you should think about that as a
possibility I think for medical
diagnosis which is and here the
test is very simple which is well you're
at least Express two tests test number
one is the absolute test which is if I
feed in a set of symptoms it generates
the correct diagnosis 100 of the time
deterministically guaranteed that's a
high bar
the other is I do that with the
algorithm and then I go to 100 doctors
human doctors and I get back 100
different responses and then let's
compare right and then let's track over
time and so if you compare to medium
doctors right and like how
good is the media doctor in the
diagnosis and like I don't know what
your experience has been like well and
the median doctor may be smart but also
maybe overloaded maybe exhausted may
have like 12 other patients 15 minutes
a lot of experiences 15 minutes you
know there's a thing here like experts
in these areas tend to either like be
like doctors themselves or they like
know a lot of doctors or they have like
their that they work in the
industry they make money they have a
concierge doctor who spends a lot of
time with them and does house calls the
media and Healthcare experience is 15
minutes in somebody's Heritage
schedule with a doctor that may or may
not ever see you again and has very
limited data and and
there's well-known algorithm which is
that they come up with a diagnosis they
come up with a treatment you go with
that doesn't work you repeat and
while not sick and while still sick and
not dead you just repeat and then I
think many of us have been through that
well and then there's and then there's
all the other sort of things so then
there's like drug interaction
is any one doctor tracking all the
interactions of your drugs then
there's this other issue which is okay
they give the prescription does is there
actually compliance for taking the
prescription does the doctor actually
know whether you're taking the
prescription is one of the biggest
disasters right but that means like the
ability for a media doctor to even
evaluate the success of a treatment they
may actually may not be able to do it
because they may not have the data on
compliance and so like you
look at the existing I don't know for me
you look at the existing system by which
this all happens it's very similar to
look into the existing system by which
people actually drive cars which is like
oh my God this is not good like this is
really not good and we kind
of fool ourselves into believing that
it's good because it kind of feels good
and we don't really want to look behind
the curtain but we look behind the
curtain and it's pretty horrifying
and so from that standpoint if
you follow that logic then it says okay
if the machine could do a better job you
know if the machine was twice as good
at just like listening symptoms
giving the response during the
prescription doing the follow-up
I mean how far I know if
you've done this but you plug in a
list of symptoms I've been playing with
it too
I mean because it does have acts I
mean it has access to the collective
medical and if it doesn't now it
can't right it could have
be filled with all the emrs all the
medical records and so on and they could
sort of learn from that as well
then the other and then the other
question I'm sure you thought about but
like okay so the medical field moves and
in the existing system the
media and doctor has to like read all
the papers which
never happens right no one has that for
that right and there's
continuing education but still it's not
the same well here's an example do you
want do you want your GP would you do
you want MGP or an lgp
presumably the old GP has more
experience and so they have more pattern
matching over time and more experienced
with patients but the MGP is probably
more up in the current science
okay and then it's like okay do you
really want to have to make that
trade-off or can the machine actually
have both of those exactly well that's
the thing is that like you talked about
how like Can it beat let's say how
does it do compared to 100 doctors when
the 100 doctors collaborate presumably
that's the ideal situation right I mean
or that sounds horrifying no
no I mean that's the wisdom of the crowd
no that's perfect
it could go well I guess it could go
either way but it's a committee usually
that's the Soviet method usually when
you actually when you pull it you can or
at least maybe it's how you collaborate
have you really found human beings to
make better decisions in groups than
they do as individuals that's a good
question in your entire life
the serious answer is the wisdom of
crowds Madness of crowds
our flip side's the same coin right
and so and when are you harnessing the
wisdom when are you descending into
madness or even just mediocrity

like it's very specific tasks
groups can do well but otherwise it's
like one big like group project from
high school which is like a
well so generally right but generally
what happens people at groups is the
social conformance kicks in right
and so people want there's a well-known
kind of thing there's like this
group polarization which is you take a
group of people who already inclined
slightly to one side of the vehicles
you put them together let them talk
for three hours they all come out much
more radical because they've
self-reinforced right well
so maybe that's really interesting thing
because you can imagine training AI to
do have these different aspects and it's
collaboration with other versions of it
would be very different it
could be very different I mean
maybe it should do like this effectively
a Monte Carlo right
run the same inputs 100 times
right well okay so I either
will never get there or we're already
there now but I think in 10 years it
does seem especially maybe we hit like
another winter but it seems like things
are accelerating so much this seems
pretty real it seems pretty real
what do you think Society needs to
change because there's like all these
things we were talking about and this
seems bigger than like just the
revolution of software over the last 20
years or internet from the last 20 years
because we're talking about how it
changes government how it changes
regulatory how it changes education I
mean I don't even know where you want to
start with that but I think that's what
something where it may take us 10 years
just culturally right to be able to get
ready for this thing that may arrive in
10 years or may already be here right
right I don't know where you want
to start so where I would start is
we've already fallen into I think we've
we've deliberately kind of fallen into
trap already which is we've only been
using a single kind of example and we've
used it both in our discussions on
medicine and also in education which is
basically a something is done today
people are doing something today and
then maybe the machine can do it instead
that's an important thing and that's
that as we're thinking about
but the way that technological impact
actually plays out in human society is
not just that the way it plays out is it
lets you basically revisit more
fundamental assumptions or what's
not being done today or what's not being
done today it all of a sudden becomes
possible and this comes this
this always comes up in any sort of
discussion about employment people
doing jobs versus machines doing jobs
people get worried about technological
displacement of jobs but that logical
displacement of job like technology
never actually creates unemployment
technology only ever creates jobs in
that
and the reason for that is to
algae makes possible things that were
not possible before which is what
to growth and so specifically for
example the role of the doctor
it's like okay the doctor of
the future is probably not going to be
doing the same right we have a
tournament in it break fix which
is kind of what doctors because
the core motion of a lot of doctors as
you said diagnose prescribe diagnose
prescribed smoking debugging
exactly doctors of the future probably
like the technologically empowered
doctor 10 years from now is highly
unlikely to be spending their day doing
that they are probably going to be
spending their day doing things that are
actually much more important than that
right and so for example maybe they
have more time right with patients
because the machine is a time
saving device
maybe they have more data to draw on
to be able to make their
decisions they've got the
machine as a part really making the
decisions maybe they're able to spend
more time in their conversation with the
patient talking about psychological
issues as compared to just physical
issues and as in a lot of
medical conditions involved two
sides of that or behavioral issues well
as like a lot of primary
medical issues today are consequence of
different behaviors and maybe
doctors should be spending more time in
behaviors and it speaks to compliance as
well as other issues awesome
I mean compliance is a
behavioral issue like why don't people
do this or that right but then also
there's all the behavioral health issues
right which is probably one of the
biggest catastrophes ever have coming
out of covet exactly right
exactly maybe doctors should be
maybe the doctor of the future will be
more of a life coach of which there
will be a pharmacological sort
of a biological or pharmacological
component right but maybe it's like
maybe it's more of sort of the
dream is sort of holistic
medicine
and so maybe the doctor the
future is just as much is a is actually
much more important and sort of
fundamental figure in your life than he
is than he or she is today that
sounds fantastic right exactly so if
I'm a doctor that that's where that's
where I would want to be towards
right and then and that and that's
probably a bigger and more important
market right and then and then
in terms of like the size of that
industry will probably expand you
know kind of correspondingly I think the
same thing is true in education like you
know the teacher 10 or 20 years
from now I hope is not doing the same
things the teacher is doing today I hope
they're doing much better things
right so for example one-to-one tutoring
like there's basically the thick
education example like there's only one
in the last like 50 years there's
basically only one known education
intervention at scale that actually
improves outcomes after
thousands of experiments it's one-to-one
tutoring which is very ancient
actually which is very right which is
the original form of Education which is
literally how people used to get used to
get educated and so maybe this
industrial the education system
we have today is an artifact of the
Industrial Age if the Industrial Age
components of it become automated the
teacher becomes freed up to actually
work more one-to-one with students the
result might actually be a significant
breakthrough in how Education Works
although the ways you're describing you
can imagine also like AI doing
one-on-one oh they're pretty
intensively there will be part of that
but also and maybe the AI is the
one-on-one and maybe and maybe in that
case the teacher is supervising the AI
right and maybe and maybe the
teacher is making sure that they as like
on the right track and doing the right
things and is able to kind of sit at the
control panel and watch all that
happening right well that speaks to
something really interesting because I
think
we're probably a little nervous at least
short term to just unleash This and like
not pay attention to it and so you'll
have the doctor using this as a tool but
keeping an eye on it you'll have the
teacher maybe scaling dramatically for
all this one-on-one but keeping an eye
on it do you think that's actually the
way it's gonna I mean this is kind of
how all Technologies work like
so it's sort of another way
to think about it is you could imagine
two acronyms for AIS and artificial
intelligence which kind of implies
replacement the one I actually
like much better is augmented
intelligence
and augmented intelligence is
it's another example the term would be
Steve Jobs a bicycle for your mind but
right or
right right so the augmentation right
and so the way if you just look at
the history of new technologies the way
it plays out is everyone's afraid it's
going to be a replacement and it turns
out it's an augmentation so you
take a human being and you give them the
technological tools they therefore are
much more productive like a factory
versus like Artisan with their tools
exactly or like
the dream of like an X an
exoskeleton any of these
things I mean look our artists are
much more productive today with digital
tools than they were with just
painting canvas and by the
way even artists that still work on
paint and canvas are much more
productive today because they can sell
their products to a much larger audience
online or like my favorite thing for art
is like photography comes
online right and that dramatically
changes art because being photorealistic
isn't that interesting anymore but so
that creates modern abstraction right
which actually is maybe even more
expressive right than just taking a
picture right and so now I can make
pictures with AI all the time right
so where does that shove art maybe to a
more interesting place and the artist
history the artists were not happy
about the introduction of Photography
because it originally is a threat
of course right but it transformed
things it turned out to be it
turned out it turned out the market
for art is much larger today than it was
oh that's interesting before the
introduction photography I mean we call
it different things we call it things
like TV shows and so forth but like the
market for Creative expression is much
much larger than it used to be by the
way music same thing right
recorded music was originally a threat
it used to be a musician would compose
and perform right and then
to have music in your home you'd have to
hire a musician to come into your home
photographs were a threat to
that but phonographs made the music
industry much larger so people who
were good at making music all of a
sudden had a much bigger Market so
I think AI is going to play out in a
very similar way like there are people
who argue AI is different
because they just keep climbing this
letter and we'll replace everything I
actually think it's going to be
basically it's the ultimate superpower
it's the ultimate pairing good we
were talking about creating screenplays
and scripts a good example if I'm a
Hollywood screenwriter today like GPT is
my best friend and I'm just sitting
there all day long and I'm just saying
playing out it's like okay I
reach this plot Point dot give
me a list of like 10 ideas for what to
do it's like oh okay that's an
interesting one I'll give you
an example how this could work so mad
men it's one of my favorite shows
Matthew weiner right in that
show and he was always pleased he's like
wow that show is so unpredictable like
you never knew where it was
going and he said well the
technique we had in the writer's room
was at any given time we had to figure
out what happened next in the plot
we would brainstorm we'd come up with
the five sort of things obviously five
obvious things
so gbt would be obvious things and you
rule those out exactly so it
pushes creativity all of a sudden every
individual screenwriter can do that
without having to have a whole writer's
room to brainstorm you just plug that in
it gives it back to you in two seconds
you're just like okay not those things
I'm gonna to do something else and
now I am more creative than I was before
right your comment about music's really
interesting because now we've got
Spotify so we got everything in your
pocket you can imagine like the AI
Spotify which is like the doctor the
personal trainer the educator like all
those different things in my pocket
available right now for whatever I need
to do that's right and with
the human escalation path right
it's like the AI therapist or
whatever but with the thing of like
well okay I really have a thing
here especially if it gets really
serious to escalate immediately
that's right okay so what's
what's going to hold us back what
do we need to change so I think it's
mostly fear so that this is where maybe
I'm a radical on it because
this is usually where people start
talking about like regulation I
think it's like we have these we have
these fear-driven reactions I always
think of it there's this deep-seated
myth in human societies of the
Prometheus myth right and then
Prometheus myth is all about
new technology right and then Prometheus
myth is like basically this new
technology of fire right and
and fire is one of these classic
Technologies where like it can be used
for good
right or it can be used very badly right
it can destroy your whole
world
and so Prometheus famously
goes and retrieves
fire from the gods and his punishment
for it is to be chained to Iraq and if
his liver pecked out every day for the
rest of Eternity right so embedded in
there is like the anxiety about the new
technology and then the arrival of the
new technology maybe is like
the fear right is that it's not bad and
the person who does that should be
punished and so I always find that myth
kind of plays out over and over again in
all these discussions about regulation
that this stuff especially
it's the gods who punish him right the
existing Gods well on behalf
on behalf of on behalf of on behalf
of existence but so I
I think generally it's this it's
just you get you get these fears if you
look at the history of we talked
about some of this if you look at the
history of new technologies they
generally have these fears every
step along the way every technology has
been created with some prediction that
it's going to upend the social order and
cause the well it does up into
some degree right and it will do that
but generally speaking in a positive
way on balance I mean
technology is why we live much better
lives today certainly people now would
not want what people had 50 years ago
nobody would make that right and you
could do you could go back in time
infinite it would be like that right
nobody would ever make this radius
nobody would ever make a trade to go
back in time it would never happen
and then right that's literally
it's because you wouldn't want to you
would not want to lose the Technologies
you have today so I think that's
true and so I actually think like fear
maybe the Jeff fear maybe the actual
biggest threat fear leads to the
kind of reach for regulation
I'm a skeptic I don't it's like I
don't know right regulating math can we
really didn't regulate math well but
it's not going to look like regulating
math right it's going to look like
regulating this superpower that's what
they're gonna say right the
actual implementation of this is
algebra regulating algebra
regulating linear algebra like are we
really going to regulate linear algebra
matrix multiplication really
seriously and then even if we
do are we gonna possibly do it
in a way that makes any sense well
okay but it won't obviously won't look
like that it'll be saying well we can't
have computers drive cars right or like
what what's the what's how do you
give the computer a test or how do
like okay you make this I'll be
the cynic so okay you make this claim
that the computer AI is better than
human like how do I know that because
that well it turns out because the
cars are driving so
that's okay so Heroes internet okay
so here's how that played out
self-driving cars it's interesting
there was one category company that said
we're going to basically wait until it's
perfect and we're going to basically try
to validate Regulators they're not
driving and they're not on the road
they're still not on the road there's
another category company that said you
know what let's evolve out of basically
the cruise control
and it's go to cruise
control and then it's radar basically
and you get humans driving with it and
you label data and exactly and you don't
expect the car to drive itself from the
very beginning the car is like an
autopilot kind of thing the expectations
you pay attention like Tesla is
the company I'm alluding to and if you
if you turn on full stop driving on
Tesla you're still you're still
told like you're not supposed to be
watching a movie you're supposed to be
actually paying attention to the car
will like alert you when it's time to
pay attention
but notwithstanding that
Tesla has been climbing the ladder on
self-driving car functionality
capability they do new software releases
push live to car at night anytime they
want those new releases are not being
tested by any federal the federal
it's whatever it is doing
these things there's no actual test
happening and that has that and
that has led to incredible progress
including as I said clearly in the
data this is now standard because you
can't drivers you can't make it work
just magically right it has to do happen
gradually right because it's right
it's actually much like Madison and it's
centering into a complex system with a
lot of variables in the real world
like medicine too it's like life or
death it's just serious but
but it then we go back to how
we started the conversation the
wait for permission thing the binary
zero or one wait for permission wait for
Perfection Thing versus the incremental
let's get better and better and better
and the threshold is it better than
humans is it is it a net Improvement
I mean clearly in self-driving cars that
second approach is the approach that's
working
and do you think you get to the Tipping
Point where look let's look at the
statistics we have because we have
all this happening right now we have the
statistics and it's like so much better
than humans why wouldn't we do it
exactly right and then at some point the
morality tips where it's like well
obviously we have to go in this
direction because it's just it's just
obviously better
I suspect we're going to get their
medicine pretty quick I'm
an optimist on that and again I'm not an
optimist because I think the a is going
to be perfect I'm an optimist because I
think the status quo is not that good
well that might be like you start
empowering doctors you give them tools
they start using them and start
empowering patients start using
them and actually here I think it's even
different than the car because you're
not on a road right it's it's
your body or whatever and actually
patients are driving their own health
care more than ever I think covet was
another sort of Tailwind there so maybe
you start maybe it's just about
developing the tools and giving them out
right well here would be an example so
let's use our screenwriting example to
play into medicine which is a
given set of conditions there may be
many possible diagnoses an
experience I've had is there's a set of
a set of symptoms one doctor comes
up with one diagnosis another doctor
comes up with a different diagnosis you
read the literature and it's like
actually both of those diagnoses in
theory are but like for some reason the
one guy I only thought of the one the
other guy only thought of the other
so a way for doctors to start using this
technology today would be plug in the
symptoms give me five possible diagnoses
okay oh I didn't even realize right
that because maybe this is a
new thing since I went to
medical school or something I didn't
realize diagnosis number three was an
option I just go look at that
right and so the doctor is still doing
the diagnosis so that's your screenplay
example your augmented as a doctor
you're augmented because in that case is
alerting you to things that you should
know but no right I mean
that's interesting it's almost like
having a mentor or just someone to
riff with that's right
and they write it's a great thing is it
is a machine it will riff with you as
much as you want like it will sit there
at three in the morning
there's a hundred times for you it's
happy to it doesn't get bored it doesn't
get tired by the way and then it
also has the advantage it has all the
up-to-date information right and
all the other outcomes and when it makes
a mistake it actually can learn from
it rather actually from being other
other than being like devastated by it
or emotionally reacting to it right
right and like self-driving cars
if it makes if some other doctor in some
other state had a patient last week and
made a mistake and they fixed the
mistake it will not make the mistake
again you're patient right
so I mean so you think so that is a
very different regulatory play than
we've seen in the history of healthcare
well I think that's just you tell me
I think that's just going to happen so
here's what everybody knows
I'll give you a couple things
everybody knows that patients should not
be on Google
everybody knows every patient now does
that it's called Dr Google
exactly literally I was called in the
field right and there's no way like
you're not practically speaking you're
gonna like regulate that out of
existence that's going to
happen I think doctors using these new
tools as an augment is something that
they could just do it doesn't require
approval so the ship has already sailed
do you think I think so and by
the way patients using GPT if it hasn't
started it's going to start imminently
probably so the patients
are going to show up with the results of
GPT queries and the doctors are going to
have to respond to that and so
they're going to end up being in this
world whether they want to be or not but
that's actually really interesting
because as a patient and I probably know
just enough about medicine to be
dangerous to myself but like I show up
with the doctor and I have all of that
thought out basically that might
equalize the patients such that
they can actually come much more
educated and cut from much more
thoughtful and they become much more in
the process as well
as a doctor do you want your patient

the patient more educated they may just
be humoring me but I think they want
maybe with you
they might look a little bit more
sideways but if it was really helpful I
think they would I think it's just about
how good it is right that's right okay
so what goes wrong like
I mean look the big thing that goes I
mean look the big thing I think two
things go so one is just that the
expectation of perfection right like
that and look it's very
it's very easy to generate the negative
headline it's very easy to set off the
scare the moral Panic basically right it
was a single instance goes wrong and
that gets extrapolated we talk
a lot about thalidomide like
it'd be very easy to have that kind of
moment or like the person on a bike
that got hit by a Tesla or something
like that I think it was biking
across a freeway right exactly and
so like a human probably hit him too
that's right oh well that's a
good point the trolley problem
the Charlie Brown's been
in the press a little bit more recently
because it turns out that Sam Bateman
freed was an expert in the trolley
problems okay it shows you that so
it's not the route ultimate morality is
it as it's been marketing
marketed but the Charlie
probably the problem always gets the
Charlie problem gets always mooded about
from self-driving cars which is
you have a choice between killing you
know I don't know it's like I don't know
five grandmas or one little kid or all
these different like you have to leave
but like human drivers don't no
no human drivers never make that
decision no they have gas or brick
right and they have I'm gonna hit the
car in front of me we're not going to
hit the car in front of me it's never
this elaborate thing it's always a very
simple thing and so it's not a question
of whether the machine can ideally solve
this sort of idealized complex
problem it's gonna get the brakes faster
right when it's about to crash in the
car directly in front of it and so
properly logically kind of containing
the expectation here to actual real
world and not having this spin off into
these like basically fantasy narratives
that you can then criticize
the so that the
absolute the absolute limits and then
look I think just the generalized
fear right and what I always have to
remind myself is like I'd like
to say I'm a software developer
but background it's like okay I can
actually like the other the algorithms
that do this like can I tell
you every aspect how they work no like
do they do I understand how they work do
I understand the basic foundations do I
understand the basic maths this
is why I make the comment about
regulating math
now to somebody who's not a coder right
this whole this all this stuff like
weird magic and
so there is a I have to remind
myself to be patient and tolerant of
people who don't understand the
mechanics of what's Happening that said
I think the people who are going to be I
think they also have to get on the
mechanics and try to understand us and
that and there's always slippage there
so what's the antidote to fear is
it optimism is it education
I mean ideal ideally I mean I think
there's ideally it's ideally it's
cultural cultural orientation towards
new technology and then ideally it's
it's education of people learning and
kind of or the CP snow
two cultures things
backgrounds coming together and kind of
educating each other honestly a big
part of it also I think is When Things
become a fatal company I mean this
is what Tesla's done with self-driving
cars like if it's just happening
right because who would want
to go back like nobody wants to go back
and like the system adapts right
and so there was this famous Uber
fought all these regulatory Wars and all
the cities that they were in because it
was not technically allowed under the
taxi limo Chargers in the beginning so
one of the things they did early on was
they just made sure that there were
always lots of Uber cars available
around State houses and City Halls
and so whenever somebody so you
literally have somebody who's like in
sort of giving this like
roaring speech in City Hall
about shutting down Uber and then they
would come out and they'd have to get
home really fast Uber would show up 20
seconds later right it's like at some
point it just was like take it for
granted and then at that point if you
just said literally are we going to take
Uber away people would have said no I
can't it's over and that's what happened
and then they and then literally what
happened is they changed the laws to
accommodate that behavior and so I
actually think part of it here is just
like having these tools okay here's the
thing here's a good news thing
these tools are becoming widely
available up front right so like 50
years ago a new technology like this
would have been like deployed in the
government first and then in big
companies and then years later in the
form of something individual people
could use the model today is like
it's just online like GPD is online
right now well the future of
paint is really intriguing because from
an engineer point of view it's the
engineer's dream that if we make it good
enough such it can get to a point where
people just love it and it's helpful and
it does what it needs to do the rest
will take care of itself
I mean I kind of think that's mostly how
things happen I mean no that's
a beautiful feature so now
look having said that Healthcare is very
sophisticated right lots of
regulations there's lots of payments
right all these things so I saw this
thing on Twitter the other day it
blew my mind right because this whole
time I've been thinking in terms of like
diagnosis all this stuff in my
life so this doctor posted a video
and I think I saw that one so that
first video and he said look he said the
problem is whatever diagnosis whatever
like I do the diagnosis I do the
prescription then it's a question of
whether or not I can get the the
insurance company to reimburse to pay
for the thing to do that for
anything even slightly out of the
ordinary I have to write a letter I the
doctor has to write a letter to the
insurance company and that letter needs
to be in a specific format and it needs
to have to make the case right make the
case and it needs to have the scientific
citations and if I do the letter
really well it's going to get paid for
and if I don't do the letter really well
it's not going to get paid for it it's
going to matter to the possibly
the life of the patient
and so he's like it turns out GPT is
really good at writing those letters
with the references with the references
with the scientific references like
full-on right and so you've got
this so that's another way I think about
it is you've got this bureaucratic
process which is legitimate and required
it needs to exist and that data needs to
be submitted and honestly it does not
matter to that process whether that
document is written by human or a
machine but all of a sudden if
every doctor in the world is really good
at writing correctly properly just
letters then all of a sudden it goes to
the thing all of a sudden that doctor
now is another whatever four
hours a week to actually take care of
patients like that's the kind of
thing that I think is going to happen
quite quickly and that what's
interesting what's interesting about
that example is you can imagine that
example having a big impact on the
efficiency of the Health Care system
today without any regulatory changes
without anything it's within the
system within the system within the
system and so and that was just and
that was the one where it's just like oh
in retrospect that's obvious I just
hadn't thought about it one guy
thinks about it all the other doctors
start to do that the whole system
upgrades step function one time
I think that kind of thing I think is a
real possibility and that could be
because everyone's working within the
system you can have the transformation
immediately but then eventually someone
has to read all those letters so that's
to validate them it's probably
some sorry NLP on the other side well
that's right it's corresponding so
there's we have this company
this company called do not pay
which is this company it's a
it's a it's an app that sort of acts
like a bot and I've used the app
it's very nice it's for people
that's right it's and it basically it'll
basically get you it started to get you
like out it was starting to get you out
of like basically sort of BS
traffic tickets
and then it's he did this thing a
while ago where it will unsubscribe you
for all these consumer
subscription services like Comcast or
whatever like they all make it hard to
like ever turn off the subscription and
so he has this way to the bot will do it
for you and so he just started using AI
in the bot and so he now so the
way a lot of consumer subscription
companies work is you can't you can
subscribe online you can't actually
unsubscribe online you have to call an
800 number and you have to argue with
the person and there's actually this
thing in these companies called save
teams where they're actually paid
specifically to prevent you from
unsubscribing and they'll try to cut
special deals with you and they'll try
to talk you out of it and so he has this
thing wired up where now he has the he
has a AI generated text within
text-to-speech oh it's just talking and
it talks and it talks it talks to the
customer service person at the end of
the line and basically with
infinite patients
we'll just sit and it will just argue
like no I am actually going to
unsubscribe no I'm not going to
accept a special offer no
no right exactly until finally the
other guy finally gives up and says okay
fine okay I'll stop charging you
and so it's like okay it was
it was a precondition of the system that
that worked the way that it did it was a
burden on people to have to deal with
that AI can now step in and equalize the
power imbalance between the customer and
the company and presuming that we'll
change the system well one would
think and to your point like step
one for changing the system might be
retaliation which is all of a sudden the
safe teams will be Bots and so maybe the
boss will be arguing with the Bots
but at least it gets you out of this
kind of kafka-esque thing you're in
today where when you deal with these big
companies you're dealing with this giant
you're an individual dealing with
a giant bureaucracy at least it like
equalizes the power well that's kind of
amazing and that will be the spark for
changing things because once you're in
that sort of system like we got to do
better than this this is crazy
right with each other all day long
it's just food it's clearly stupid
and especially when it's
Bonds on both sides now we can finally
say well Let's do an API on both sides
so let's do something smart on both
sides just connect it
well Mark I mean that's such a sort of
beautiful optimistic view of how this
could go right because the future we're
talking about is actually a much more
engineer driven that if an engineer can
build this and it really works it
really helps patients it really changes
things it will get adopted as it gets
adopted cultural work around it and will
love it and will not want to go back and
then the future will just be right in
front of us I mean patients are
going to get a vote Yes doctors are
going to get a vote right and you
know this it gets in it so it's
an industry made up of people a world
many other people will get a vote
beautiful thank you so much for
joining us good you bet foreign
