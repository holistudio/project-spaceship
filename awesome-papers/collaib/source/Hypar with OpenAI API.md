AH: Do you think we'll be interacting with BIM and design applications this way in the future? "Replace all the Aeron chairs on the third floor with the Steelcase Amia" "Rename all the rooms in this wing sequentially following the pattern A101, A102, A103, etc". Greg Schleusner AIA posed a good question on twitter â€” as a discipline, do we have sufficiently precise language to communicate unambiguously what we would want a system like this to do for us?

Oana Taut: This is exciting. However, Iâ€™m still trying to understand if there is use beyond the fascination. What do you think?

My (quasi historical ðŸ˜…) thought process:

-humans develop speech and use it to communicate ideas

-humans abstract ideas with drawings and use it to pass knowledge through generations. Some humans are better at it than others. Architecture is built around this diferenciating ability

-architects create rules to further abstract concepts and define the drawings of buildings

-tech creates the ability to abstract the rules and create more precise and complex drawings and buildings

(Each step before evolution meant: abstraction enables to capture more breath of information)

-AI becomes more mainstream and learns speech

â€¦.

Is it the logical next step to teach it to draw and forget all the abstraction and rules we already built specialisation around?

Will future architects draw space like an essay? Leave dimensions, proportions, fine tuning, not to mention analysis that informs space, to AI (stochastic initialisation)

With no intention to dismiss this fantastic work, I think we can design more utility and efficiency with AI, even is it means less fascinating results.

AH: I love this comment. I don't think a technology like this means we have to abandon the tools already at our disposal â€” I don't even think that's possible. I imagine the ideal future design scenario being highly multi-modal â€” AI-powered with high-level text descriptions (and loose sketch inputs too!) as well as manual precision data entry, modeling, explicit commands + operations, all working together.

We don't share design ideas with our colleagues by talking to them (exclusively) â€” mostly we draw, sketch, model, and gesture. So there's no reason to expect text will be sufficient on its own for steering an algorithm towards a desired design outcome.

Different communication + design media privilege different aspects, and we'll always want to use the best tool for the job. I think "essay" form will be great for outlining the high-level broad strokes + constraints of a project, but we'll immediately need to dive in and start manipulating results directly.
