## Chapter 1 - Prologue

"build a mind from many little parts, each mindless by itself"
 - agent - small process that do simple things
 - combining agents into societies -> true intelligence

"I wish I could have lined them up so that you could climb straight to the top...Instead they're tied in tangled webs....I'm inclined to lay the blame upon the nature of the mind: much of its power seems to stem from just the messy ways its agents cross-connect."

### 1.1 The Agents of the Mind

Scales of time
- slow - billions of years of brain evolution
- fast - weeks of infancy
- in-between - centuries of ideas throughout history

Questions that need answering
- How do agents work
- What are they made of?
- How do they communicate?
- Where do the first agents come from?
- Are we all born with the same agents?
- How do we make new agents and change old ones?
- What are the most important kinds of agents?
- What happens when agents disagree?
- How could such networks want or wish?
- How can groups of agents do what separate agents cannot do?
- What gives them unity or personality?
- How could they understand anything?
- How could they have feelings and emotions?
- How could they be conscious or self-aware?

The point is not to answer these questions separately, but answer them with a society of agents that work with each other to explain the mind

### 1.2 The Mind and the Brain

It was long thought that Life was something unique from other matter until von Neumann showed how cells reproduce and Watson/Crick showed DNA enabled those copies.

The Mind - how thinking works - has yet to really have this explanation

### 1.3 The Society of Mind

Pick up a cup of tea:
 - GRASPING agent holds cup
 - BALANCING agent keep the cup steady
 - THIRST agent wants to drink the tea
 - MOVING agent wants to get the cup to your mouth

"For me and a whole generation of students, the world of work with children's blocks has been the prism and the pendulum for studying intelligence."

"In science, one can learn the most by studying what seems the least."

### 1.4 The World of Blocks

BUILDER agent - makes towers from blocks
- but this is too complicated
- So ask help from other agents
- BEGIN agent - choose a place to start a tower
- ADD agent - add a new block to a tower
	- FIND
		- SEE
	- GET
		- GRASP
		- MOVE
	- PUT
		- MOVE (notice this is connected to GET and PUT)
	- RELEASE
- END agent - decide if the tower is high enough

"Though all grown-up persons know how to do such things, no one understands how we learn to do them"

"The amnesia of infancy, makes us assume that all our wonderful abilities were always inside our minds, and we never stop to ask ourselves how they began and grew."

### 1.5 Common Sense

"Common sense is not a simple thing. Instead, it is an immense society of hard-earned practical ideas"

BUILDER agent by itself just turns other agents on/off
As an agency, BUILDER does what its sub agents collectively accomplish

"As agency, it seems to know its job. As agent, it cannot know anything at all."

Get comfortable switching perspectives between agent and agency

## Chapter 2 - Wholes and Parts

### 2.1 Components and Connections
It's not enough to design each agent, but design how the different agents are organized and interact with each other for the larger system's goals.

### 2.2 Novelists and Reductionists
"The 'laws of thought' depend not only upon the properties of those brain cells, but also on how they are connected"

"In physics, we're used to explanations in terms of perhaps a dozen basic principles. For psychology, our explanations will have to combine hundreds of smaller theories. To physicists, that number may seem too large. To humanists, it may seem too small."

### 2.3 Parts and Wholes

"I suspect the actual function of such terms \[like 'holistic' and 'gestalt'] is to anesthetize a sense of ignorance."

Two sets of questions, first subjective, next objective
- What makes a drawing more than just its separate lines?
- How is a personality more than a set of traits?
- In what way is a culture more than a mere collection of customs?

 - What makes a tower more than separate blocks?
 - Why is a chain more than its various links?
 - How is a wall more than a set of many bricks?

"Why do the 'objective' questions seem less mysterious? Because we have good ways to answer them, - in terms of how things interact."

This resembles Christopher Alexander's [[Pattern Language]] - it's not just the pattern of buildings and features but how they interact with the pattern of daily life.

"Many people assume that those 'subjective' kinds of questions are impossible to answer because they involve our minds. But that doesn't mean they can't be answered. It only means that we must first know more about our minds...But this is a subject about which we have never learned very much...Such questions will be answered in time. But it will just prolong the wait if we keep using pseudo-explanation words like "holistic" and "gestalt."...It's harmful, though, when naming leads the mind to think that names alone bring meaning close."

This might be agreeing and disagreeing with the Quality in [[Zen and Art of Motorcycle Maintenance]] - though Pirsig could say that Minsky is concerned with the subjective quality and not the Quality that gives rise to subjective and objective thoughts, etc. Minsky is clearly advocating for an objective approach to the mind to break it down into parts AND reminding us that the interactions between parts helps explain for the "greater than the sum of its parts" effect. So Minsky would still agree that "something is destroyed when you cut things up into pieces - but you gain something else as well." Pirsig may only caution that, in attempting to break down the human mind to explain how it works, one risks failing to explain the nature of reasoning behind breaking down the human mind.
