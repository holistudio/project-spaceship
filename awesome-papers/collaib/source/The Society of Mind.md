## Chapter 1 - Prologue

"build a mind from many little parts, each mindless by itself"
 - agent - small process that do simple things
 - combining agents into societies -> true intelligence

"I wish I could have lined them up so that you could climb straight to the top...Instead they're tied in tangled webs....I'm inclined to lay the blame upon the nature of the mind: much of its power seems to stem from just the messy ways its agents cross-connect."

### 1.1 The Agents of the Mind

Scales of time
- slow - billions of years of brain evolution
- fast - weeks of infancy
- in-between - centuries of ideas throughout history

Questions that need answering
- How do agents work
- What are they made of?
- How do they communicate?
- Where do the first agents come from?
- Are we all born with the same agents?
- How do we make new agents and change old ones?
- What are the most important kinds of agents?
- What happens when agents disagree?
- How could such networks want or wish?
- How can groups of agents do what separate agents cannot do?
- What gives them unity or personality?
- How could they understand anything?
- How could they have feelings and emotions?
- How could they be conscious or self-aware?

The point is not to answer these questions separately, but answer them with a society of agents that work with each other to explain the mind

### 1.2 The Mind and the Brain

It was long thought that Life was something unique from other matter until von Neumann showed how cells reproduce and Watson/Crick showed DNA enabled those copies.

The Mind - how thinking works - has yet to really have this explanation

### 1.3 The Society of Mind

Pick up a cup of tea:
 - GRASPING agent holds cup
 - BALANCING agent keep the cup steady
 - THIRST agent wants to drink the tea
 - MOVING agent wants to get the cup to your mouth

"For me and a whole generation of students, the world of work with children's blocks has been the prism and the pendulum for studying intelligence."

"In science, one can learn the most by studying what seems the least."

### 1.4 The World of Blocks

BUILDER agent - makes towers from blocks
- but this is too complicated
- So ask help from other agents
- BEGIN agent - choose a place to start a tower
- ADD agent - add a new block to a tower
	- FIND
		- SEE
	- GET
		- GRASP
		- MOVE
	- PUT
		- MOVE (notice this is connected to GET and PUT)
	- RELEASE
- END agent - decide if the tower is high enough

"Though all grown-up persons know how to do such things, no one understands how we learn to do them"

"The amnesia of infancy, makes us assume that all our wonderful abilities were always inside our minds, and we never stop to ask ourselves how they began and grew."

### 1.5 Common Sense

"Common sense is not a simple thing. Instead, it is an immense society of hard-earned practical ideas"

BUILDER agent by itself just turns other agents on/off
As an agency, BUILDER does what its sub agents collectively accomplish

"As agency, it seems to know its job. As agent, it cannot know anything at all."
