[[Beyond Heuristics - A Novel Design Space Model for Generative Space Planning in Architecture]]
 - A design space model is defined as a a finite set of input parameters + evaluation of each solution based on pre-defined metrics.
 - there is "little discussion of how the design space model can be evaluated by designers before the optimization is run."
 - the quality of the design space model can be evaluated in terms of:
	 - Bias and Variance tradeoff - what is the scope of the design space model?
	 - Complexity vs continuity - what is the internal structure of the design space model?
