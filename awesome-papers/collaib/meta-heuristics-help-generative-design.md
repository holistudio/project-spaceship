[[Beyond Heuristics - A Novel Design Space Model for Generative Space Planning in Architecture]]
 - defines metaheuristics as "stochastic algorithms that can find optimal solutions to complex problems by iteratively sampling possible solutions, evaluating them based on specified performance factors, and using this information to derive better and better designs"
 - algorithms that introduce some randomness and iterate on design based on performance evaluation, rather than relying on rules of thumb ([[design-heuristics-limit-creativity]])
 - generative design tries to widen the search and evaluation of design with algorithms that introduce some randomness. These metaheuristics basically help the designer explore other options that they themselves wouldn't have otherwise considered.
