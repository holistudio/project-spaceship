There are many ways to evaluate a design based on the experience of occupants in the space.

[[Beyond Heuristics - A Novel Design Space Model for Generative Space Planning in Architecture]]
Context: Autodesk University Exhibit Hall
- Constraints: no-go zones of egress/restrooms etc, overall boundary, entrances to the floor
- Avenues subdivide the space into a collection of smaller parcels/cells (parameter set 1)
- Three avenues starting points fixed at entrances, end points can move around the boundary edges (3 parameters)
- Merge parcels into larger regions to meet program requirements (parameter set 2)
- 11 major expo programs that branch off immediately from the avenues - 1 point along the avenue line (seed point) and a vector that stops when the smaller parcel/cell areas add up to a program's requirements: "A neighbor is chosen for merging with the starting cell, such that the resulting area minimally meets the area requirements of the given program. If all neighbors fall short of meeting the area requirement, the largest neighbor is chosen for merging.
- "To reduce the dimensionality of the design space, we chose not to individually parameterize the location of the F&B programs. Instead, these programs are always located at the ends of the primary and secondary avenues, where they hit the exterior walls of the expo hall." 

**Metrics**
- "all exhibitor areas are evenly activated without creating undesirable congestion in any particular area" 
- ""buzz," measures the spatial distribution of high traffic areas in the plan (Figure 4a)...large amount of foot traffic, but distribute this foot traffic evenly throughout the plan."
- "the average foot traffic around each exhibitor booth (Figure 4b). Higher values of exposure represent plans where a large percentage of booths have a high level of traffic surrounding them."
- "static graph-based simulation method, which is fully described in a related paper" 

[[Sequence of Spaces Quote]]
**Quote:** "Our experience of an architectural space is strongly influenced by how we arrive in it. A tall, bright space will feel taller and brighter if counterpointed by a low-ceilinged softly lit space. A monumental or sacred space will feel more significant when placed at the end of a sequence of lesser spaces. A room with south-facing windows will be more strongly experienced after one passes through a series of north-facing spaces." [[occupant-experience-influenced-by-sequence-of-spaces-qualities]] 

**Notes:**
There could be a way to [[evaluate-design-based-on-occupant-experience]] using metrics regarding not just each space, but also the sequence of spaces the occupant goes through.
