[[Sequence of Spaces Quote]]
**Quote:** "Our experience of an architectural space is strongly influenced by how we arrive in it. A tall, bright space will feel taller and brighter if counterpointed by a low-ceilinged softly lit space. A monumental or sacred space will feel more significant when placed at the end of a sequence of lesser spaces. A room with south-facing windows will be more strongly experienced after one passes through a series of north-facing spaces." 

There could be a way to [[evaluate-design-based-on-occupant-experience]] using metrics regarding not just each space, but also the sequence of spaces the occupant goes through.
