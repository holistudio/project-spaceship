A log of project progress and specific lessons learned.

## Milestones

- [ ] **Mercury**: A 3D block environment within Unity's GUI that can read a JSON file to display an arrangement of blocks of predefined sizes.
- [ ] **Venus**: A labeled dataset of 3D models of object that are built with blocks of predefined sizes
- [ ] **Earth**: A trained Block Planning Agent
- [ ] **Moon**: Revisit overall approach. Is RL a necessary part of this approach?
- [ ] **Mars**: Build a standalone 3D block environment app
- [ ] **Jupiter**: Use trained Block Planning Agent to pre-train Object Recognition RL Agent
- [ ] **Saturn**: Connect AI Agents to 3D block app
- [ ] **Uranus**: Local user testing
- [ ] **Neptune**: Deploy the 3D block app to the web
- [ ] **Pluto**: Build a spaceship and explore the universe
