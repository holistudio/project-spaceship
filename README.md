AI that helps you build a SPACESHIP

## What does this thing do?

After you start stacking a few blocks, the AI guesses at what you are trying to build and then stacks a few more blocks to partially complete it. Then you stack a few more blocks and the whole process repeats. Hopefully, the AI does know what you are trying to build and suggests good additional blocks. You and the AI would then be collaboratively building an object you want.

So if you want to build a spaceship (SPACESHIP!!!), this AI will help you build it.

## What's the pie-in-the-sky version of this project?

A game-like environment where anyone can play with the AI on the web. The AI can also chat with you asking if you are trying to build a certain object. You can also correct the AI through the chat interface and the AI will try to suggest better blocks that help complete the thing you are trying to build. From these interactions with people across the web, the AI continues to learn how to suggest better blocks. The chat interface that documents what the AI guesses and your feedback can also serve as a record of how people feel when collaborating with AI.

## What's the MVP version of this project?

A locally run Unity3D game where you stack blocks to make a common 3D object and the AI states a guess at what that object is and adds a few blocks to partially complete the 3D object geometry.

Additionally, a survey of questions on people's subjective experience building blocks with AI can document if the AI is really helping with people's creativity and efficiency.
